# FlowTime - Simple Focus Tracking Web Application

FlowTime is a straightforward Flask web application designed for tracking focused work or study sessions. The motivation behind creating this tool stems from the lack of simple and distraction-free alternatives available for this purpose. The aim is to provide users with a minimalist and user-friendly interface for consistent and efficient focus tracking.

As part of future enhancements, there is consideration for hosting the application with a login interface using Google authentication to enhance user experience and accessibility.

Feel free to ask for any specific improvements or modifications you have in mind for the application!
